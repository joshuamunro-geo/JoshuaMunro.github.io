# About Me

Hello there!

I am a stable isotope geochemist pursuing a PhD at the University of Texas at Austin.

Born and raised in South Africa, I did my undergraduate degree in Geology and Chemistry at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. I then moved to the University of Cape Town to do my 4th year and Masters degree under Prof Chris Harris, studying the H-O-C stable isotope geochemistry of the Phalaborwa Complex, South Africa.

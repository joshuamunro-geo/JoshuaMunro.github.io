## About me
Hello there!

I am a stable isotope geochemist pursuing a PhD at the University of Texas at Austin.

Born and raised in South Africa, I did my undergraduate degree in Geology and Chemistry at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. I then moved to the University of Cape Town to do my 4th year and Masters degree under Prof Chris Harris, studying the H-O-C stable isotope geochemistry of the Phalaborwa Complex, South Africa. 

## Research
My main focus is the application of stable isotope geochemistry to igneous and metamorphic geology problems. This started with the Phalaborwa Complex, South Africa, which is a [carbonatite-foskorite](## Rock types) pipe dominated by diopside pyroxenites. My [work at the University of Cape Town] 
Combining hands-on fieldwork and lab work is very important to me, and I am building towards having my own research lab at a university.

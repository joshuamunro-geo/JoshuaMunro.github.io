## About me
Hello there!

I am a stable isotope geochemist pursuing a PhD at the University of Texas at Austin.

Born and raised in South Africa, I did my undergraduate degree in Geology and Chemistry at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. I then moved to the University of Cape Town to do my 4th year and Masters degree under Prof Chris Harris, studying the H-O-C stable isotope geochemistry of the Phalaborwa Complex, South Africa. 

## Research
My main focus is the application of stable isotope geochemistry to igneous and metamorphic geology problems. This started with the Phalaborwa Complex, South Africa, which is a [carbonatite-foskorite](## Rock types) pipe dominated by diopside pyroxenites. My [work at the University of Cape Town] on the Phalaborwa Complex involved looking at the O-H-C stable isotopes to identify whether the rocks were consistent with a kimberlitic/carbonatitic magma assimilating local granite-gneisses and whether the source of the magma showed non-mantle-like isotope values similar to the coeval (but much larger) Bushveld Complex, South Africa. More about that work can be read by following this link to see the published paper [Munro & Harris 2023] (https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egad063).
At the University of Texas, I moved more into understanding the effects of subduction on the non-traditional stable isotopes, Ca, Zn and Mg. Specifically, using North American eclogites to 'examine' the stable isotopes values produced by the low-angle, low-temperature subduction of the Cretaceous Farallon Slab. this contrasts nicely with lots of work that has been done back home, where high temperature eclogites have been studied.
Combining hands-on fieldwork and lab work is very important to me, and I am building towards having my own research lab at a university.
